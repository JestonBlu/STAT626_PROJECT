abstract = {We propose a classical approach to estimate factor-augmented vector auto-regressive (FAVAR) models with time variation in the parameters. When the time varying FAVAR model is estimated by using a large quarterly data set of US variables from 1972 to 2012, the results indicate some changes in the factor dynamics, and more marked variation in the factors' shock volatility and their loading parameters. Forecasts from the time varying FAVAR model are more accurate, in particular over the global financial crisis period, than forecasts from other benchmark models. Finally, we use the time varying FAVAR model to assess how monetary transmission to the economy has changed.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the ability of autoregressive models, professional forecasters, and models that incorporate unemployment flows to forecast the unemployment rate. We pay particular attention to flows-based approaches-the more reduced-form approach of Barnichon and Nekarda (2012) and the more structural method in Tasci (2012)-to generalize whether data on unemployment flows are useful in forecasting the unemployment rate. We find that any approach that considers unemployment inflow and outflow rates performs well in the near term. Over longer forecast horizons, Tasci (2012) appears to be a useful framework even though it was designed to be mainly a tool to uncover long-run labor market dynamics such as the "natural" rate. Its usefulness is amplified at specific points in the business cycle when the unemployment rate is away from the longer-run natural rate. Judgmental forecasts from professional economists tend to be the single best predictor of future unemployment rates. However, combining those guesses with flows-based approaches yields significant gains in forecasting accuracy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Changes in the unemployment in Croatia are largely permanent. However, transitory movements account for most of the unemployment dynamics after 2008. Unemployment series is non-stationary but mean-reversing, non-linear with structural breaks and significant white and red-noise in the data. This paper estimates Multivariate singular spectrum model (MSSA) to explain overall fluctuations in unemployment registered during 1998-2013. Unemployment behaviour in Croatia shows evidence of cyclo-stationarity caused by seasonal employment effects. We use 88 time series (variable) to explain observed fluctuations with our MSSA model explaining 76{\%} of the total unemployment variance comprehensively. Evidence of this study demonstrates that unemployment phenomena should be modelled by using a non-linear model with multivariate singular spectrum models giving more robust and empirically valid results in relation to standard modelling techniques. A 5-6 years limit cycle for unemployment is isolated dominating unemployment behaviour in Croatia over the last two decades. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Background: The current financial crisis is having a major impact on European economies, especially that of Spain. Past evidence suggests that adverse macro-economic conditions exacerbate mental illness, but evidence from the current crisis is limited. This study analyses the association between the financial crisis and suicide rates in Spain. Methods: An interrupted time-series analysis of national suicides data between 2005 and 2010 was used to establish whether there has been any deviation in the underlying trend in suicide rates associated with the financial crisis. Segmented regression with a seasonally adjusted quasi-Poisson model was used for the analysis. Stratified analyses were performed to establish whether the effect of the crisis on suicides varied by region, sex and age group. Results: The mean monthly suicide rate in Spain during the study period was 0.61 per 100 000 with an underlying trend of a 0.3{\%} decrease per month. We found an 8.0{\%} increase in the suicide rate above this underlying trend since the financial crisis (95{\%} CI: 1.009–1.156; P = 0.03); this was robust to sensitivity analysis. A control analysis showed no change in deaths from accidental falls associated with the crisis. Stratified analyses suggested that the association between the crisis and suicide rates is greatest in the Mediterranean and Northern areas, in males and amongst those of working age. Conclusions: The financial crisis in Spain has been associated with a relative increase in suicides. Males and those of working age may be at particular risk of suicide associated with the crisis and may benefit from targeted interventions.},

Fuzzy time series methods have been used in almost all areas, such as environmental science, economy and finance. The concepts of labour force participation and unemployment have great importance in terms of both the economy and sociology of countries. For this reason there are many studies on their forecasting.

abstract = {This article examines the persistence of unemployment in the USA and four Eur-opean countries by means of fractionally integrated ARMA (ARFIMA) models. In doing so, a type of ¯ exibility in modelling low-frequency dynamics not achieved by non-fractionally ARIMA models can be provided. The results indicate that the unemployment series are much more persistent in some countries such as the UK and France, than in others including Germany or the USA. I . I N T R O D U C T I O N This article is concerned with the dynamics underlying both the short-run and long-run behaviour of unem-ployment in the USA and four European countries. Traditionally, two schools of thought exist concerning the behaviour of unemployment. One approach focuses on the determinants of the long-run equilibrium level. The other concentrates on the movements of unemploy-ment between equilibria. Using econometric skills, the method of distinguishing between the approaches is by examination of the order of integration of the series. Thus, if unemployment is I {\ldots}1 , i.e. if it follows a unit root process, the shocks aOE ecting the series will have per-manent eOE ects, shifting the unemployment equilibrium from one level to another. If this is the case, a policy action will be required to bring unemployment back to its original level. On the other hand, if unemployment is I {\ldots}0 , the eOE ect of the shocks will be merely transitory and as a result, less need will exist for policy action, since unemployment will in any case return to its equilibrium level sometime in the future. The I {\ldots}0 and I {\ldots}1 speci{\textregistered} cations are, however, too restric-tive in comparison to the huge range of possibilities cov-ered by the fractionally integrated {\ldots}I {\ldots}d models, in which the time series observed is modelled as {\ldots}1 ¡ L d x u t ; 1; 2},

@article{Wagstaff1985,
abstract = {M. Harvey Brenner's numerous time-series analyses of the relationship between population mortality rates and aggregate unemployment rates have attracted considerable attention from academics, policy-makers and the mass-media. Over the course of the last few years, however, Brenner's studies have begun to be subjected to critical scrutiny by econometricians. This paper provides a survey of these studies and concludes that-contrary to what is often claimed-Brenner's analyses do not provide convincing evidence that the social costs of unemployment include premature deaths. ?? 1985.},
