Notes on write-up:

1-I made a file for the LaTeX code.  If you are interested in modifying and you haven't used LaTeX before you might want to try http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ as an editor. Or http://texstudio.sourceforge.net.
  -Although, I don't mind doing all the LaTeX coding if you don't want to play with it.  Please don't feel obligated.
  
From the original readme file we have:
Team Members and Responsibilities (edit as you wish)
    -Joseph: Plots, Data Prep, Code Management
    -Alison: Write up. I'd be happy to do writing.
    -Sean: Presentor, Write up?
    -Travis: I can do the diagnostics.
    -Akarshan: Final Write up and Model selection and fitting.
    -Bo: Model fitting, plots, final write up

Based on the professor's emails, we may need to adjust some of the above.

I would like to start putting together the final paper and then adding to it little by little. So, please let me know if there is anything you would like added? If you are interested in changing anything as it gets added, feel free.  However, you can also email me word documents or post segments here and I can integrate it in with my writing.  (In fact that might be easier.)

I am going to go finish watching the videos and then sometime this weekend I will get the final paper started and start working on collecting the bibliography I have so far in a shareable format.

Just wanted to let everyone know where I am and keep the communication lines open.
