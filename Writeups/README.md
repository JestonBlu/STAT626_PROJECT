I made a file for the LaTeX code.  If you are interested in modifying and you haven't used LaTeX before you might want to try http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ as an editor. Or http://texstudio.sourceforge.net.

Although, I don't mind doing all the LaTeX coding if you don't want to play with it.  Please don't feel obligated.
