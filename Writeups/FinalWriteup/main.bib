@article{insecure,
Abstract = {Background: Though previous research repeatedly found that being employed is better for health than having no job at all, evidence suggests that employment is not always beneficial for health. With especially job insecurity reflecting a contemporary health risk for the employed, a systematic review was performed to assess if insecure employment can be as detrimental for health as unemployment, and to determine whether these associations vary according to different health measures and among men and women.; Methods: The literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Embase and PsychInfo. In order to allow a more accurate comparison between the two risk factors, studies were included if the data for job insecurity and unemployment was ascertained from the same sample, and contained a quantitative analysis for both exposures towards one (or more) health outcome(s).; Results: Out of 375 articles, in total, 13 studies were included in the systematic review. In 24 analyses contras},

Abstract = {The relationship between unemployment and suicide has changed over time and in particular during the Great Recession. Using state-level panel data covering the years 1979-2010, the study indicates that unemployment's impact was insignificant during the first half of the sample period, but was highly significant during the second half. In addition, while the impact has generally become stronger over recent decades, it fell during the Great Recession although remained significant. Evidence suggesting that increased economic insecurity helps explain the growing sensitivity over time is offered. The models fit the data well, explaining up to 90% of the variation in state suicide rates.; © 2014 The American Association of Suicidology.},

I study an educational reform in Sweden which prolonged the vocational programs in upper secondary school and gave them a considerably larger general content. The research design exploits variation across regions and over time in the implementation of a large-scale pilot which preceded the reform. I examine the students' labor market experiences during the 2008−2010 recession, at which time they had reached their late 30 s. I find no evidence that having attended a longer and more general program reduced the risk of experiencing unemployment. Among students with low GPAs from compulsory school, attending a pilot program seems instead to have led to an increased risk of unemployment. This pattern is strongest among male students and the effect is likely to be explained by the increased dropout rate which resulted from the change of the programs.},

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t- test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression with the SPSS Statistics version 23 Program. Results The number of close friends was weakly correlated with depression and ego-resilience: specifically, the number of close friends had a weak negative correlation with depression, and a weak positive correlation with ego-resilience. Factors significantly influencing the students' ego-resilience were depression, type of residence, frequency of exercise, and gender, with a total explanatory power of 18{\%}. Conclusion These findings indicate that intervention programs to improve ego-resilience should be developed. Research into ego-resilience should be replicated with students from a variety of cultural background and diverse study areas.},

Research on the impact of unemployment has increased in sophistication, strengthening the causal conclusion that unemployment leads to declines in psychological and physical health and an increased incidence of suicide. This work has elucidated the risk factors and mechanisms associated with experiencing poor psychological health during unemployment; less so for physical health and suicide. Psychologists have begun to contribute to the study of factors associated with reemployment speed and quality. The past decade has especially illuminated the role of social networks and job search intensity in facilitating reemployment. Evidence suggests some individuals, especially members of minority groups, may face discrimination during their job search. Although more work in this arena is needed, several intervention-based programs have been shown to help individuals get back to work sooner.},

abstract = {Parental unemployment is closely related to poverty and economically stressful conditions in family life (Harland et al., 2002). In 2008, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, the Greek population started facing a serious socio-economic turmoil. During the year 2013 the rate of unemployment appears to be close or even greater than 27{\%}. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of parental unemployment on the development in students of PTSD symptoms that are related to exposure to school bullying. Participants were 2377 primary school students from Athens. The questionnaires were group-administered in each classroom : 3 types of questionnaires : Demographic Information Questionnaire, Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (Frederick, 1985), Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (Olweus, 1996-2006). The findings showed that children that reside in families that both parents are unemployed have on average significantly higher PTSD scores related to exposure to school bullying. According to our view the greater PTSD scores in the group of students that experience paternal unemployment can be an outcome of severe economic stress in family life that influences their psychosocial development and reduces their capacity to overcome successfully adverse events, such as school bullying. Also, the presence of various emotional problems that are more common in this group of students according to previous findings (Harland et at.,2002), maybe played a role in reducing the threshold for the development of PTSD symptoms. Properly designed interventions should provide support to students that experience economically stressful conditions, such as paternal unemployment.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the ability of autoregressive models, professional forecasters, and models that incorporate unemployment flows to forecast the unemployment rate. We pay particular attention to flows-based approaches-the more reduced-form approach of Barnichon and Nekarda (2012) and the more structural method in Tasci (2012)-to generalize whether data on unemployment flows are useful in forecasting the unemployment rate. We find that any approach that considers unemployment inflow and outflow rates performs well in the near term. Over longer forecast horizons, Tasci (2012) appears to be a useful framework even though it was designed to be mainly a tool to uncover long-run labor market dynamics such as the "natural" rate. Its usefulness is amplified at specific points in the business cycle when the unemployment rate is away from the longer-run natural rate. Judgmental forecasts from professional economists tend to be the single best predictor of future unemployment rates. However, combining those guesses with flows-based approaches yields significant gains in forecasting accuracy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Changes in the unemployment in Croatia are largely permanent. However, transitory movements account for most of the unemployment dynamics after 2008. Unemployment series is non-stationary but mean-reversing, non-linear with structural breaks and significant white and red-noise in the data. This paper estimates Multivariate singular spectrum model (MSSA) to explain overall fluctuations in unemployment registered during 1998-2013. Unemployment behaviour in Croatia shows evidence of cyclo-stationarity caused by seasonal employment effects. We use 88 time series (variable) to explain observed fluctuations with our MSSA model explaining 76{\%} of the total unemployment variance comprehensively. Evidence of this study demonstrates that unemployment phenomena should be modelled by using a non-linear model with multivariate singular spectrum models giving more robust and empirically valid results in relation to standard modelling techniques. A 5-6 years limit cycle for unemployment is isolated dominating unemployment behaviour in Croatia over the last two decades. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {With the unemployment rate becoming a prominent factor in monetary policy decisions in recent years, forecasting the path of the rate in the near term has taken on a new urgency. How well do our current methods do in this task? We look at the performance of various publicly available forecasts, along with some econometric models, and evaluate their success at forecasting the unemployment rate in real time around the Great Recession. Unfortunately, the forecasting approaches we analyze performed very poorly until the beginning of the recovery. We discuss some possible reasons for this poor forecast performance.
