Some further notes:

This template is developed for Scientific Workplace 5.5 and has not been
tested on other versions.

For proper output, you need the graphic \texttt{EconEpsilon.jpg}, available
at \texttt{www.economics-ejournal.org}. Place it in the graphics directory
of your SWS installation \texttt{C:\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}swp55\TEXTsymbol{%
\backslash}Graphics\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}}. If you place the graphics
somewhere else, you have to change the first line in the preamble
accordingly. Currently it is\newline
\texttt{\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}newcommand\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}%
typopath\{C:/swp55/Graphics/EconEpsilon\}}.

If the file \texttt{EconEpsilon.jpg} is located in \texttt{C:\TEXTsymbol{%
\backslash}Documents\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}New}, the line has to be changed
into\newline
\texttt{\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}newcommand\TEXTsymbol{\backslash}%
typopath\{C:/Documents/New/EconEpsilon\}},\newline
for instance.\ (Note that you have to replace backslashes by slashes in the
path. Avoid blanks in paths and filenames, as LaTeX may not swallow them. I
have not tested that with SWP, though.)

Make sure that you compile with pdflatex. (View and print as PDF).

For the \ bibliograhy, use the Economics E-Journal stylesheet \texttt{%
EconEJ.bst}, available at \texttt{www.economics-ejournal.org}. In order to
make it available, you have to copy this stylesheet to the BibTeX directory
of your Scientific Workplace installation. Refer to SWP Help \ for
instructions on how to handle BibTeX style files and to create
bibliographies.)

For pictures and tables, right-click on the object and use float placement
on top of page. Remove all other ticks.
