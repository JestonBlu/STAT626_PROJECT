# Forecasting US Unemployment

#### Reproducible Research

All of the findings, models, and graphs discussed in our writeup can be reproduced using scripts from this repository. The following are a few guidelines to make sure you can run our code with minimal effort:

* Clone or download the project to your desktop, unzip if neccesary
* Within R, set the working directory to `setwd("stat626_project location")`
* Load the seasonally adjusted dataset `load("Data/Data_Prep.rda")`
* `RScripts/All_Final_Models.R` creates the ARIMA and VAR models
* `RScripts/Preso_Plots.R` creates all of the plots used in the write up.
